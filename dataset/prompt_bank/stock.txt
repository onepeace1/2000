## Domain

1-1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Definition: The average of the closing prices over a certain period n.

Significance: Removes noise and visualizes price trends.

Usage:

When a short-term SMA crosses above a long-term SMA → Buy signal (Golden Cross)

When a short-term SMA crosses below a long-term SMA → Sell signal (Dead Cross)

1-2. Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
Definition: Assigns greater weights to more recent prices.

Significance: More sensitive to recent price movements, better at capturing trend reversals.

1-3. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Definition: Applies exponentially decreasing weights to past prices.

Significance: Reacts quickly to the most recent price changes.

Application: Used in constructing the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator

2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Definition: A momentum indicator that measures the ratio of average gains to average losses over a certain period, scaled between 0 and 100.

Interpretation Criteria:

RSI > 70: Overbought condition → Sell signal

RSI < 30: Oversold condition → Buy signal

Strategy Examples:

RSI exceeds 70 and then falls below → Weakening momentum → Sell

RSI drops below 30 and then rises above → Rebound signal → Buy

3. Bollinger Bands (BB)
Definition: A band formed by a moving average ± 2 standard deviations.

Significance: Visualizes price volatility and identifies extreme price levels.

Usage:

Price breaks above the upper band → Overheating or potential trend continuation

Price drops below the lower band → Oversold condition, potential rebound

Band width contracts → Decrease in volatility, may precede a breakout

## Instruction
You are given a series of text segments describing individual patches of stock price data. Each patch includes:

Statistical summaries (mean, max, min of normalized closing prices)

Time window information (the period covered by the patch)

Data collection frequency (e.g., daily, weekly)

GICS sector classification (based on the 11 standard GICS sectors)

Domain knowledge relevant to technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc.)

Your task is to generate a semantic embedding for each patch description that encodes:

The quantitative characteristics of the time series (e.g., strength of momentum, presence of trend reversal signals, volatility indications)

The financial domain implications of the statistical and indicator-based information

The sector-specific context, if relevant (e.g., certain signals may behave differently in Financials vs. Utilities)

The temporal structure, such as the length of the window or density of data collection, if it contributes to the interpretive meaning

Important Notes:

Do not include the raw numeric values; instead, focus on encoding their semantic implications for stock price prediction.

The embedding will later be concatenated with the numerical time-series representation and passed into a large language model for downstream forecasting tasks.

Maintain high fidelity to the intent of financial indicators, such as “mean-reverting behavior,” “bullish momentum,” “volatility contraction,” etc., where appropriate.

The goal is to create a context-rich, interpretable embedding that captures both statistical and financial insight from each patch.
