1-1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Definition: The average of the closing prices over a certain period n.

Significance: Removes noise and visualizes price trends.

Usage:

When a short-term SMA crosses above a long-term SMA → Buy signal (Golden Cross)

When a short-term SMA crosses below a long-term SMA → Sell signal (Dead Cross)

1-2. Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
Definition: Assigns greater weights to more recent prices.

Significance: More sensitive to recent price movements, better at capturing trend reversals.

1-3. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Definition: Applies exponentially decreasing weights to past prices.

Significance: Reacts quickly to the most recent price changes.

Application: Used in constructing the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator

2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Definition: A momentum indicator that measures the ratio of average gains to average losses over a certain period, scaled between 0 and 100.

Interpretation Criteria:

RSI > 70: Overbought condition → Sell signal

RSI < 30: Oversold condition → Buy signal

Strategy Examples:

RSI exceeds 70 and then falls below → Weakening momentum → Sell

RSI drops below 30 and then rises above → Rebound signal → Buy

3. Bollinger Bands (BB)
Definition: A band formed by a moving average ± 2 standard deviations.

Significance: Visualizes price volatility and identifies extreme price levels.

Usage:

Price breaks above the upper band → Overheating or potential trend continuation

Price drops below the lower band → Oversold condition, potential rebound

Band width contracts → Decrease in volatility, may precede a breakout
