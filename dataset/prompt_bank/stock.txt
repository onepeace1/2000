## Domain

1-1. Simple Moving Average (SMA)
Definition: The average of the closing prices over a certain period n.

Significance: Removes noise and visualizes price trends.

Usage:

When a short-term SMA crosses above a long-term SMA → Buy signal (Golden Cross)

When a short-term SMA crosses below a long-term SMA → Sell signal (Dead Cross)

1-2. Weighted Moving Average (WMA)
Definition: Assigns greater weights to more recent prices.

Significance: More sensitive to recent price movements, better at capturing trend reversals.

1-3. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
Definition: Applies exponentially decreasing weights to past prices.

Significance: Reacts quickly to the most recent price changes.

Application: Used in constructing the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator

2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Definition: A momentum indicator that measures the ratio of average gains to average losses over a certain period, scaled between 0 and 100.

Interpretation Criteria:

RSI > 70: Overbought condition → Sell signal

RSI < 30: Oversold condition → Buy signal

Strategy Examples:

RSI exceeds 70 and then falls below → Weakening momentum → Sell

RSI drops below 30 and then rises above → Rebound signal → Buy

3. Bollinger Bands (BB)
Definition: A band formed by a moving average ± 2 standard deviations.

Significance: Visualizes price volatility and identifies extreme price levels.

Usage:

Price breaks above the upper band → Overheating or potential trend continuation

Price drops below the lower band → Oversold condition, potential rebound

Band width contracts → Decrease in volatility, may precede a breakout

## Instruction
You are given expert-level domain descriptions and statistical summaries derived from time-series patches of stock price data. Your task is to generate an informative embedding of this text that captures both:

Statistical characteristics of the patch, and

Financial domain knowledge relevant to price prediction.

The goal of this embedding is to enrich a downstream time-series forecasting model (LLM-based) by incorporating contextual understanding of technical indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands) and their implications in trading decisions.

Requirements:

Focus on encoding key concepts that reflect momentum, volatility, trend direction, and signal strength as suggested by the indicators.

Prioritize interpretability and predictive relevance over generic embeddings.

Do not include raw numeric values or compute outputs—your job is to semantically encode the meaning and implications of the textual content.

The resulting embedding will be concatenated with numerical time-series features and used as input for a downstream model to predict future price movement.
